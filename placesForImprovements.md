There is always place for improvement

If I have had unlimited time to spend on this project... I would do a lot of things.
I've decided to list them to show that I am aware about them.

1. Change API from GET to POST in "create account" and "transfer", and provide data in body
2. Generate unique tranferId for each transfer, and return more data when transfer is successful
3. Improve logging
4. Wrap BigInteger into Ammount class, to allow for easy change between data types.
5. Analyze with implementation of TransferExecutor is quicker and more robust
6. Add handling unexpected errors during transactions.
7. And much more :)
