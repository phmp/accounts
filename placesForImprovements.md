#There is always place for improvement

If I had had unlimited time to spend on this project... I would have done a lot of things. List below:

1. Change API from GET to POST method in "create account" and "transfer" operations and provide data in body
2. Generate unique transfer id for each transfer, and return more data when transfer is successful
3. Improve logging
4. Wrap BigInteger into Amount class, to allow for easy change between data types.
5. Analyze with implementation of TransferExecutor is quicker and more robust
6. Add handling unexpected errors during transactions.
7. Configure pom to run integration tests separately in "verify" phase.
8. And much more :)
